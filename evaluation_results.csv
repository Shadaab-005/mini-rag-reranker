What is the primary purpose of the EU Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC?,True,True,SICK — Guide for Safe Machinery: Six Steps to a Safe Machine,SICK — Guide for Safe Machinery: Six Steps to a Safe Machine,0.7309770584106445,0.8046885429473747,"the directives are freely available, e.g., at eur-lex.europa.eu . they apply to manufacturers and organizations that place machinery on the market in the Euro pean Union . the Directives apply to machines and safety compo nents . it establishes the necessary tasks for new machines to meet health and safety requirements .","the Directive 2006/42/EC addresses manufacturers and distributors of machines and safety compo nents . it establishes the necessary tasks for new machines to meet health and safety requirements in order to dismantle trade barriers within Europe . by 1995, this directive had to be applied in all EC Member States ."
What are the two methods to show compliance with the Machinery Directive?,True,True,Rockwell — Machinery SafeBook 5,Rockwell — Machinery SafeBook 5,0.6852178573608398,0.7701990962028504,"new machinery and second hand machinery from outside the EU must provide minimum requirements given in an annex of the U.W.E. Directive . if the machine is listed in Annex IV of the Machinery Directive, special conformity assessment procedures must be met . the manufacturer must document all relevant hazards/risks and counter measures with test results .",the machinery Directive covers the supply of new machinery and other equipment including safety components . it is an offense to supply machinery within the EU unless the provisions and requirements of the Directive are met . a detailed risk assessment must be conducted to ensure that all potential hazards are addressed .
What does “residual risk” mean in machine safety?,True,True,Rockwell — Machinery SafeBook 5,Rockwell — Machinery SafeBook 5,0.6145971417427063,0.7312642544376511,the risk Graph or Table must not be used in isolation or in an overly simplistic manner . the risk estimation must be repeated taking into account any foreseeable changes in the way that people may intervene with the machine . if the protective measure fails they will be at a greater risk than envisaged before .,each method is intended to take account of the detailed content of the standard . the risk Graph or Table must not be used in isolation or in an overly simplistic manner . it is important to repeat the risk estimation after the protective measure has been chosen .
What does Diagnostic Coverage (DC) indicate?,True,True,"IFA — Functional safety of machine controls (Application of EN ISO 13849), IFA Report 2/2017e","IFA — Functional safety of machine controls (Application of EN ISO 13849), IFA Report 2/2017e",0.657520055770874,0.7643071940105074,"DC is a measure of the effec- seen here to be a value relating to the tested unit (e.g. the tiveness of a control system's self-test and monitoring block) and not to the test equipment . a simplified approach of EN ISO 13849-1 allows only a mini- mum total of 65 points and even then, only for SRP/CS .",DC is a measure of the effec- seen here to be a value relating to the tested unit (e.g. the tiveness of a control system's self-test and monitoring block) and not to the test equipment .
What does CE marking allow manufacturers to do?,True,True,Eaton — Safety Manual (EN ISO 13849-1 and IEC 62061),Eaton — Safety Manual (EN ISO 13849-1 and IEC 62061),0.7463183403015137,0.8477910041809082,"the CE marking must be carried out before putting the product onto the Affix CE mark market, i.e. before selling and commissioning . imports into the EU are also safety requirements of the relevant directives and EN standards . the manufacturer takes full responsibility for the affixing of the CE for use, devices, tools and machines .",CE marking must be carried out before putting the product onto the market . importation into the EU is also safety requirements of the relevant directives and EN standards . the manufacturer takes full responsibility for the affixing of the CE marking .
What tool is provided by IFA to calculate PL?,True,True,"IFA — Functional safety of machine controls (Application of EN ISO 13849), IFA Report 2/2017e",IFA — SISTEMA Cookbook 1,0.5369403958320618,0.6649986945573532,EN ISO 13849-1 has a con- that has already been developed in the field . it contains valu- involvement of experienced experts at the IFA . the previous EN 954 standard with its purely deterministic requirements has finally been re-placed .,"the safety-related parts of machine controls can be implemented in accordance with EN ISO 13849-1 . for this purpose, the machine design engineer must calculate the probability of a dan- gerous failure per hour (PFH) in order to determine the Performance Level (PL)"
Explain how a two-hand control device helps protect workers.,True,True,Rockwell — Machinery SafeBook 5,SICK — Guide for Safe Machinery: Six Steps to a Safe Machine,0.6404021978378296,0.7713056325912475,"two-hand controls must be operated concurrently (within 0.5 s of each other) to start the machine . this ensures that both hands of the operator are occupied in a safe position (i.e., at the controls) and therefore cannot be in the hazard area . a new function may only be initiated if both controls have been actuated .",two-hand control devices are designed to be movable (ergonomics) a spacer ring ensures that the safety distance from the hazardous point is main tained . a new function may only be initiated if both controls have been released and then actuated .
What is the main purpose of functional safety in machinery?,True,True,Rockwell — Machinery SafeBook 5,Rockwell — Machinery SafeBook 5,0.7034178972244263,0.7996588706970216,"functional safety was a term introduced in IEC 61508:1998 . it covers a broad range of devices that are used to create safety systems . devices like interlocks, light curtains, safety relays, safety PLCs and safety contactors are interconnected to form a safety system, which perform a specifi c safety-related function .",functional safety is the part of the overall safety requirement . a safety function is implemented by the safety-related parts of the machine control system to achieve or maintain the equipment under control in a safe state with respect to a specifi c hazard or set of hazards .
